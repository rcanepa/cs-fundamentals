"""Traverse a binary tree in order, without using a stack or recursion.
It must be done in place.

Steps:
1. Initialize current as root
2. While current is not NULL
   If current does not have left child
      a) Print currentâ€™s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Make current as right child of the rightmost
         node in current's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
